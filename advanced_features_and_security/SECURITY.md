# Security Implementation for LibraryProject

## HTTPS Enforcement
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- HSTS headers configured:
  - `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000` (1 year)
  - `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True`
  - `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True`
- Ensures browsers always use HTTPS for the site and subdomains.

## Secure Cookies
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` → session cookies only sent over HTTPS.
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` → CSRF cookies only sent over HTTPS.
- Prevents session hijacking and CSRF attacks over insecure connections.

## HTTP Security Headers
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"` → prevents clickjacking.
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` → prevents MIME-type sniffing.
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` → enables browser XSS filter.

## Proxy SSL Detection
- `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')`
- Required when Django is behind a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache).
- Detects HTTPS requests correctly to prevent redirect loops.

## Deployment
- Nginx/Apache configured for SSL with valid certificates.
- All HTTP traffic redirected to HTTPS.
- Reverse proxy headers set for secure detection.
- TLS 1.2+ enforced with strong ciphers.

## Recommendations
- Regularl
